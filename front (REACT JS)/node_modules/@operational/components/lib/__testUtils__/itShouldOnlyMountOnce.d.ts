 * A test hack to checks if a component does not re-mount on every render
 * Need this since we dont have access to life-cycle methods of the component we want to check,
 * we pass a child with a tracker because if the parent node un-mounts, all its children un-mount.
 *
 * Therefore, **we can only use this test for components that accept any children**.
